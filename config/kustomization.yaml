# Each entry in this list must resolve to an existing
# resource definition in YAML.  These are the resource
# files that kustomize reads, modifies and emits as a
# YAML string, with resources separated by document
# markers ("---").
#
# This kustomize configuration mimic's what is deployed by OLM, essentially *only* what is required
# for the hive-operator.
